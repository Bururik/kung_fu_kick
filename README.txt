#Kung_fu_kick 
##WELCOME!!!   
 - This module is a 'just in case' version of the famous Left Pad that broke node.js some time back
  -  This module has four arguments that are essential to the functionallity of the module.       
##First Argument __the enemy__   

##Second Argument __distance__   

## Third Argument __between__   

__*NOTE*__ If a fourth argument is missing the output will default to an 'L' situation.   

###It is worth noting that this module has error handlers in case of unexpected inputs...and remember __*Don't be a Script Kiddie!*__
