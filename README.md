#Kung_fu_kick 
##WELCOME!!!   

- This module is a 'just in case' version of the famous Left Pad that broke node.js some time back
  -  This module has four arguments that are essential to the functionallity of the module.       


##First Argument *"The Enemy"*   

- This argument can be a string or integer and denotes the "character" that will be kung fu kicked by our module.

##Second Argument *"Distance"*   

- This argument can also be a str or int and denotes "how far" our "character" will be kicked back.

## Third Argument *"Between"*   

- This argument can *ONLY* be be a string so be careful, it denotes what to put in between the 'off screen kicker' and the kicked 'character'.   

##Fourth Argument *"Direction"*   

- This argument (as before) can *ONLY* be a string and denotes which direction the 'character' was kicked to.
 - This argument is unique as it must be stated by either the L or R characters.

__*NOTE*__ If a fourth argument is missing the output will default to an 'L' situation.   

###It is worth noting that this module has error handlers in case of unexpected inputs...and remember __*Don't be a Script Kiddie!*__
