#Kung_fu_kick 
##WELCOME!!!
- This module is a 'just in case' version of the famous Left Pad that broke node.js some time back
 - This module has four arguments that are essential to the functionallity of the module.
##First Argument __the enemy__
- This argument can be a string or integer and denotes the "character" that will be kung fu kicked by our module.
##Second Argument __distance__
- This argument can also be a str or int and denotes "how far" our "character" will be kicked back.
##Third Argument __between__
- This argument can *ONLY* be be a string so be careful, it denotes what to put in between the 'off screen kicker' and the kicked 'character'
##Fourth Argument __direction__
- This argument (as before) can *ONLY* be a string and denotes which direction the 'character' was kicked to.
 -  this argument is unique as it must be stated by either the L or R characters.
__*NOTE*__ If a fourth argument is missing the output will default to an 'L' situation.
### It is worth noting that this module has error handlers in case of unexpected inputs...and remember __*Don't be a Script Kiddie!*__
